1. How do I approach designing software?
   
   The first thing I considered is what am I designing and what does the documents require. I like to start by precisely going through any reading materials and asking questions to help me identify different ideas I can implement to analysis and determine if I can use the idea or discard it. Working on this project I wanted to keep the design very simple. The goal was to create a simple design while breaking the programs down into smaller pieces. This way I can ensure that I give every detail of the project the attention that was needed to successfully showcase my scene to the best of my ability.This techique I applied helped me in learning about the different concepts that the opengl program presents. The way the course was set up really helped with applying this techique as the course focused on a single aspect a week. Building up to the grand finale, I started crafting my idea scene and the easiest way of implenting my idea. I also learned along the way the functions that the opengl libraries offer and how to use them to help with adding additional functionality to my scene. I'm constantly working on refining the techique to advance my skills as a programmer. I feel like the more I apply this way of programming it will help me continue grow as I continue along in this journey in software engineering.




2. How do I approach developing programs?

 The approach that works for me is slow and steady. I think that testing while writing your code adds extra security in preventing potiental bugs. This techique helped me identify bugs easily because of the smaller area of code that was needed to be investigated to locate the error. Working on this project was the biggest project I've worked on so far so taking my time to understand how each section of the program worked was beneficial with the development of the project.
 I was able to reuse created code to keep the program simple and organized because the program was large and I wasnt comfortable with working on such a program so I simplified fuctions and methods to help better understand how to use them in the design.


3.How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Learning different disciplines that in the computer science can benefit me because there is so much there is to learn about computer science. Taking different classes under the computer science umbrella can help with finding the particular field that interest me the most. It also introduces you to different principles thats associated with the different computer science fields and the different perspective the aligned with the particular science. This class has given me an introduction into the world of computer grahics and while it isn't a field I'm interested in the principles I've aquired in this class can be used in other aspects of computer science. As I continue to grow my wisdom in computer science the lessons from this class and the skills I've aquired will build my knoweledge and help lay the foundation to becoming a successful programmer.
